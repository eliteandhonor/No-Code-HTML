# No Code HTML Builder

A single-page web app that generates and iteratively refines HTML using a custom AI endpoint.

## Usage

Open `no_code_builder.html` in your browser, describe the page you want, and click **Generate**. Use **Continue**, **Coach**, and **Next Step** to expand or improve the page. The **Edit** button opens an embedded code editor (Ace) so you can adjust the HTML manually. AI-powered changes merge with existing markup rather than replacing it, and your progress is saved locally, so you can close the page and continue later.

## Development

The app relies on CDN-hosted libraries: Bootstrap, jQuery, animate.css, AOS, FontAwesome, and clipboard.js. No build step is required; simply open the HTML file.
